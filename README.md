Developed a web-based Simon Says game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implemented the classic Simon Says gameplay where the user must repeat a sequence of colors generated by the game. Utilized HTML for structuring the game interface, CSS for styling elements and creating animations, and JavaScript for game logic, including sequence generation, user input validation, and score tracking. Implemented features such as difficulty levels and a responsive design for optimal gameplay across different devices.
